# cpp-cli-geometer

This is a simple geometric calculation program running in a command line interface. It was developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with the C++ programming language.

## Introduction

The geometric calculation of objects has a history going back to ancient Egypt. While trying to calculate the areas of agricultural lands, the ancient Egyptians discovered geometric formulas and built the pyramids with these formulas.

We can calculate the circumference, area and volume of an object using geometric formulas. Perimeter and area calculations are two-dimensional (width and height) geometric calculations. Volume calculations are three-dimensional (width, height and depth) geometric calculations.

In the first version of Geometer, simple two-dimensional geometric presentations, formulas and calculations (square, triangle, rectangle) are available. I made such a choice because of its simple display in the command line interface. Volume calculations and more geometric presentations and calculations may be added in future versions.

This is the second program I developed while learning the basics of programming. You can access the source code of this program and run and test it in your own development environment.

Technology and tools I used while developing this program:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- C++
- Git
- GitHub

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/headdawnLight/cpp-cli-geometer.git

Run and test the source codes in your own development environment. 

## Usage

Step by step

1. Enter the number code to see one of the geometric shapes listed in the menu.

2. Enter the required edge lengths for geometric calculations. (Please use numeric values.)

3. The program completes the geometric area and perimeter calculation and returns to the menu. (Go back to the first step)
